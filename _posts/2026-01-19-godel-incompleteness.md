In this article, I want to get more philosophical about some concepts I've been thinking about for years now. 

I've studied quantum mechanics and went down the rabbit hole, dove into the uncertainty principles, the spooky actions at the distance, the inversion of causal order, the time crystals, and the myriad of interpretation of quantum mechanics. 

Recently I watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pO0WZsN8Oiw&t=1s) from [Machine Learning Street Talk](https://www.youtube.com/@MachineLearningStreetTalk), and suddenly a certain number of disparate elements started to click to fall into one coherent place. What if how western science is presenting *science* is actually wrong?

Something that became more and more clear to me with the advance and spreading of LLM's (Large Language Model) is how language might not be so special after all. In this so-called *modern era*, we often hear that humans are superior to animals because we have the *unique* capacity to put our internal mind state into a precise language. The verbal communication, as some anthropologists suggest, is probably the root of our assumed, *superiority* over the animal kingdom. I remember in a class about cognition at McGill university, the teachers were probing us into thinking about that set us apart from other animals. And all the discussions lead to the eureka moment, where we all concluded that, we are more intelligent because knowledge is transmitted from one generation to another. Hence, verbal language is actually the most prominent technology that is putting us at the top of the hierarchy. An ability that, we like to comfort ourselves, is only reserved to humans, ... Right?

Well, I guess if the west listened to other traditions, it might realize that actually, this is not true at all. But no need to go as far as doing cultural appropriation, since our current state of science is now providing evidence that language might actually be much more common through the animal kingdom than what *we* thought...  very surprising, is it? So yes, actually some bird might have verbal language, such as the Japanese Tit, along others birds, with a syntax, and precise wording, for exampl0e, for [naming specific predators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmys2abx4co). Whales and as other Cetacea, also have [patterns of language very similar to humans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnhCUYvDHdU&t=1s), and Elephant might be able to give names to their peers. These are just a small sample of the recent discoveries, or should I say more adequately, *re*discovery, the *modern world*, is making. 

Wording the world, is thus something not only human can do. Except that one might still argue, that we do have something more than other animals doesn't seem to have. An obsession for words. The world of words then began to word everything that the world has to offer to the wording world. Words were not merely a useful technology, serving humans to exchange their emotions and need. Over the million of years, it is as if, words became entities themselves, alive in us, fighting wars with *us*, playing with *us*, *playing* us.

*Opinions*, then, seemed to matter more than anything else, into defining an identity. A sexual attraction, a desire to belong, accept and welcome, a desire to befriend, and spend time, *with*. *Opinion*s, at the glorious era of, [the near *AGI*](https://www.businessinsider.com/agi-predictions-sam-altman-dario-amodei-geoffrey-hinton-demis-hassabis-2024-11), or so are we told to believe, become the most defining principle of unification / boundary. The **stories** about who we are, became more important that what we *actually* are, and in fact, the push to the marketization of identity as a product, tied to brands, labels, and objects, is very revealing of that shallowing and superficiality into which oneself can so easily fall into. Swept away in an endless stream of distraction, gamification of the horror, in accumulation of likes and dislikes, forming gigantic casinos of the obscene, all feeding our omnissia-god like machines, [GAFAM gluttons](https://manuneuro.github.io/EmmanuelCalvet//digital/mycelium,/gafams,/alternatives/2025/01/24/feed_the_beasts.html).

So what does this all have to do with Gödel's incompleteness theorem, you might ask, and I would answer : **everything**.

The issue with verbal and written language, is in the realization of it's limit, it is, and will forever be, inconsistent and incomplete. For example, as a friend of mine was proposing sarcastically : "try to explain, only by written text, what is left, and right." You'll often end up in tautology like, "well left is the side where I write (or not)". In most cases, you will have to assume an embodied knowledge of space, that no word can in fact capture. Now my friend adding : "try that without using your body as reference, ..." There is, indeed, a presupposition in the wording. It can only work as a pointer to a lived experience, but can never indicate what the experience is, in itself. That is to someone who is oblivious to said experience. In other "words", I can only talk to someone about what is relatable to that person. Other than that, I am going to point in an abstract cognitive space that has not yet been mapped. 

This is why it is for example absolutely impossible to explain to someone who never did psychedelics what it is like, to have a trip. The only thing you can do, is give a very rough pointer, an approximation, that will just left the person feeling confused, and in the best case, maybe curious, but that's all. You cannot do much. 

I could talk to you about the time dilation, the inversion of causal order, the dilation and contraction of space, the fractals, the holograms, and the synaesthesia, but that would again assume that you have an embodied experience related to each of these specific terms, in order for you to roughly get a sense of, "oh, this might be where he is projecting in the lived experience space". That approximation you will make will be "false", so to speak, and when you actually live the experience yourself, suddenly, you realize the mismatch between the initial language based pointer, and the actual lived experience vector : "Ah wow, this is what you were talking about, now I get it!".

So anyway, yes, (verbal) language is a lost cause, as I was [rapping](https://soundcloud.com/lameaiguisee/apeiron-part-1?si=52f5ed6b9ecc4b82a658bd91ee8f0fa6&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) about, but not all language are equal, right? In fact, some person with a minimal mathematical background could eloquently react to my initial statement about explaining left and right, and come with their smart explanation : 

> Yes, you can actually describe this, it is rather trivial in fact. For any given scene or object, take a reference line separating it into two parts, take another orthogonal line separating the first line into two parts, and now you have a coordinate system. Everything on the $x$ coordinate (horizontal axis) with negative value will be what we call *left*, from the point of reference being $x=0$, aligned with the vertical line, and everything that is to the *right*, correspond to a positive value of $x$. You see, easy I said!

And yes, this is a relatively satisfying answer, except that all of this is based on geometry, and it already completely assumes knowledge about space. It is built from the analysis of space, done by a certain specie who is very reliant on its visual system, who inferred the rules governing it. Now someone could even go as far as saying : "yeah well okay, forget about geometry, I can also give a purely algebraic definition". But then again, who, without an already pre-existing sense of space embodiment, could actually make sense of the algebra ? You are still trapped into words, without it, and meaning eludes you. 

This is it, we are exactly at the same exact state, that the mathematical representation of our best scientific model, quantum mechanics, *is*: ==no one fucking knows what it means==!

And this is not a joke, we reached a limit in our ability to know what this model really means about reality. We are now in an era, of "opinions", about what reality is, fundamentally, composed of, and coming from. Okay, "interpretation", is the word that scientist might prefer, to not feel insulted. But to be frank, this is not very different. You have more than a dozen different interpretation of what the so-called "wave function", means in quantum mechanics. Some say "shut up and calculate", that is the *Copenhagen interpretation*, and there is some wisdom to it. In a way it says : "In the absence of clarity about what it all means, let's suspend our judgment, and use it, as long as it works, i.e., is not contradicted by experiments". As a dear friend reminded me, this is very much aligned with the thinking of Ludwig Wittgenstein: 

>**“Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.”**  
— _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_ (1921), Proposition 7

This is the point where the lived experience breaks, and no one knows anymore what all this math means. My culture has no lived experience that can really unambiguously resonate with the direction that the math is pointing toward, as it points to a direction in the cognitive space that has not yet been mapped. Richard Feynman said that quantum mechanics escape our mental model, and that it is not possible to visualize it. 

I like very much that approach because it is kind of putting us back into our place. It is a sort of lesson of humility from the universe. I was once a partisan of the Leibniz school of thought that, "If we had complete information, we could deduce everything about the world.", only to see my world view completely shatter after my first course of quantum mechanics. To be honest, it is the first time I experienced a true awakening. Guess what, the second time, was with **psychedelics**. 

Interestingly, these two things seems to go hand in hand. I have been since wondering how psychedelics might provide us with lived experience that could help us into deciphering what the math is actually trying to point at. Obviously, in doing so, I was still trapped, unknowingly, into Leibniz camp. 

I mean, not that it is not interesting, nor useful. After all, the splitting we are seeing in science might only be temporary, and it is possible that a set of experiment might validate, or for instance invalidate, some or all of the existing interpretations. At the current state of affair, it seems we know a few things about reality : 
- it is either real, but non-local;
- or local, but not real. 

Whatever this means, is also subject to interpretation, but you have partisans in each camp, defending their version of reality, and trying to argue why it is better, all the while ferociously working to provide falsifiable experiments. At least, we know for fact now, that two distinct particles, whatever the distance separating them, can be "entangled", in such a way that they act as one indivisible system. Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser and Anton Zeilinger won the Nobel Prize in 2022, for showing that. Now whether Nobel Prize are worth something or not is beyond the scope of this article, and anyway, you probably already know my position about this by now, but the fact remains, that the particles seems to follow the equation of quantum mechanics very *religiously*, so to speak!

The issue being, again, we still do not know what these equations mean ! Is the wave function describing a physical object, or is it just a mathematical abstraction giving good results, much like the geocentric model from Ptolemy ? Some people try to treat the wave function as a real object, and particles moving on top of it, like in the case of the Böhm's interpretation. This would also mean the current model is incomplete, and lacking some global variables. And some consider it merely as a tool to compute probabilities. All the while, another big issue is measurement, and everybody seems confused as to what it actually means. Some say it is strictly to be understood as interaction, some say it involves observers, and hence consciousness, some say it doesn't even exist, as in the multiworld interpretation from Everett! 

This is all nice and very exciting that debates in science like that exist, but this is also very concerning in a way. The polarization that is very present in our societies, from opposing opinions, seems to be, in a way, also projected into these quantum interpretations. In fact, you could say that all the flavours of philosophies have their own interpretation of the theory, from the most ardent defender of Leibniz worldview, in the form of superdeterminism, to the materialist aficionado, as in Bohemian mechanics, to the most spiritual, participatory universe and others, where consciousness is seen as fundamental. 

So yeah, the divide in the lived experience, is projected onto the unknown direction that this abstract, but so precise, math is pointing towards, and I am starting to wonder, after all the years invested in trying to learn about all this, if a given "camp", can in fact ever win the game of interpretation, or if we will be *left* wondering, forever, in the *right* universe.

Now that might sound a bit depressing for some people but fear not. Since the article was about Gödel's incompleteness, I am kind of obliged to integrate this at some point, right, otherwise, it would be somewhat misleading, like these fake news article [selling you pills to heal your joint, but in fact making you sick](https://www.supplementdolphin.com/heal-n-soothe-scam/?utm_page=heal-n-soothe-scam). 

So yeah. At this point, I feel like, what I am pointing at is almost as big as the freaking Burj Khalifa and its 828 meters. But hey, I am going to name the elephant in the room. 

> What if logic is not enough?

What if beyond all our models of reality, lies a reality, untouched, untouchable maybe. I guess this is, by essence, what Gödel's incompleteness theorem is stating :

> In every consistent formal system containing elementary arithmetic, there are propositions that can neither be proved nor disproved within the system.

What if with quantum mechanics, we just touched into something so deep about the universe that mathematics alone, is not sufficient to capture it. Our intuitions, sensations, feelings, and embodied experience, then become the sole source of truth, because our formal proof stop working. What if, multiple interpretations might be true, all the while being mutually exclusive? 

What if, the quest for the simplest explanation and more elegant models, was a projection of our fears of the complexity and the unknown. What if beyond lies a reality so complex, that no model can every fully grasp it? No equation can ever explain, and only belief, opinions, and ultimately faith remains. 

I mean, this might be experienced as a loss, to be grieved for sure, but what about the gains?

### The gains might be huge !

I mean, after the painful realization that there are fundamental limits to what we can know, there might also suddenly be room, a lot of room, for so many cosmogonies, to *be*, and be accepted as equally *valid*. There might be a reopening of the western thinking to older traditions, and maybe even a reckoning of its own shadow. 

Maybe [pluralism](https://omniharmonic.substack.com/p/fork-you?r=c7o1l&triedRedirect=true) might emerge as the most natural thing in the universe, and maybe, in the acceptance that our cognition, as these formal models, have axioms that are true, that can never be proved, we will find unity in the plural, union in the dual, true and not true, might then be held, at the same time and space. Right and wrong, cherished, as the same child. Smart and dumb, seen, as the same lie. Separation from opinions, boundaries from cognition, from words splitting, as in Young's experiment, as photons passing through both slits and collapsing into particular patterns. We confuse the map for the territory, the syntax for meaning, the logic for truths. 

Obsessed that we are by naming, calling, labelling, we are now teaching our obsession to learning machines, and we are impressed at their ability to reproduce our thinking. But *who* is naming the thing, that if they can do this, with such rudimentary mechanics, maybe language is actually not so much our thing. Not our essence in any means, not the end goal of the evolution tree, but just a temporary meme. Not the miracle that we thought, nor the pinnacle that we ought.

So yes, a mechanical system can reproduce your thinking. But it can never, **never**, give it meaning.

> We will always need *you*, to give meaning.
